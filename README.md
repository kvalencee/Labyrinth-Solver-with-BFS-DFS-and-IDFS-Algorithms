# Labyrinth-Solver-with-BFS-DFS-and-IDFS-Algorithms
This repository contains a maze-solving system using three uninformed search algorithms: BFS, DFS, and IDFS. It allows users to input a maze with a start and end point and visualize the solution process step-by-step or decision-by-decision, displaying the discovered map and solution tree.
